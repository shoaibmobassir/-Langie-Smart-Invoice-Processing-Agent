## 📝 Script (Word-for-Word)

### [0:00-0:30] INTRODUCTION
"Hi! I'm [Name]. This is **Langie** - an intelligent invoice processing agent built with LangGraph. It automates invoice processing with a 12-stage workflow, but here's what makes it special: it processes routine invoices automatically, and automatically pauses for human review when it detects problems. Let me show you."

### [0:30-1:00] PROBLEM
"Traditional invoice processing is manual and slow. Langie solves this with 12 automated stages that handle everything - from OCR extraction to accounting entries. But if something doesn't match, it automatically pauses and asks a human to review. Best of both worlds."

### [1:00-2:00] AUTO-COMPLETE DEMO
"I'm submitting an invoice for $1000 that matches a purchase order. Watch it process automatically through all 12 stages - intake, OCR, matching, reconciliation, approval, posting, notifications - and complete. No human needed. Status: COMPLETED. Decision: 'No Review Needed'. Done in seconds."

### [2:00-3:30] HITL DEMO
"Now, an invoice for $6000 that doesn't match. The workflow processes, but when it reaches matching, it detects the problem - match score too low. Automatically pauses at CHECKPOINT_HITL and appears in the review queue. I review the details, see why it failed - $5000 difference. I select ACCEPT and submit. Watch - the workflow automatically resumes, completes all remaining stages, and finishes. Intelligent automation in action."

### [3:30-3:50] FEATURES
"The Database Preview shows all invoices. Filter by status, sort by date or amount. Each invoice has complete workflow details - all stages, decisions, timestamps - full audit trail. Plus file upload with OCR, automatic pause and resume, and complete visibility."

### [3:50-4:00] CONCLUSION
"Langie demonstrates production-ready invoice processing with LangGraph - 12-stage automation, intelligent human-in-the-loop, complete audit trails, and full-stack implementation. Ready for deployment and extension. Thank you!"
